          <p> Welcome to my Work Term Report. This page outlines my experience working at Sonova as 
              a <strong><u>Test Automation Developer</u></strong>, from <em>May 1, 2022 - September 1, 2022</em>.

              <br><br>
              My name is Elman Islam, and I am a University of Guelph software engineering co-op student in my 4th year.  
              During this work term, I became exposed to a large selection of different tools that many real life automation developers use.
              I also learned a lot more about the process of reporting bugs, and the documentation that comes with it. 
              <br><br>
              In this website page that I wrote, you can learn about my experience at the workplace, what my goals were, and the skills I gained. Use the navigation

        <div class="image-container">        
          <img id="cooperators-office" src="../images/location.jpg" alt="Co-operators office">
          <p><mark><em>130 Macdonell Street Guelph, Ontario</em>, headquarters of <u>Co-operators Group Limited</u></mark></p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-content width-80">
          <p><strong>The Co-operators Group Limited</strong> is a Canadian insurance company with its headquarters located in downtown Guelph. The company
          provides quotes for auto, home, farm, life, and health insurances, and is regarded as one of the biggest insurance companies in Canada. They cover 
          $56.4 billion assets that are under management.

          <br><br>
          To get a quote for an insurance policy, the company provides a software tool called <strong><a href="https://www.guidewire.com/products/policycenter/"> 
          Guidewire PolicyCenter</a></strong>, which is an insurance policy administration system. As a member of the test automation team of 5 developers 
          and a senior manager, my role in the team was to run automated test cases that would test for bugs or deficiencies on the website. The scripts 
          I ran would make a computer pretend to be a client and submit input and data into the system (e.g. quoting for car insurance), which easily 
          allows identifying any bugs or defects that the website has. This job is therefore related to the testing and maintenance aspect
          of the software development lifecycle. Since it is an online web application, a decent knowledge of front-end frameworks and HTML is also handy. 
          <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2 id="goals" style="padding-top: 3.3rem; margin-top: 0rem;"> <mark>GOALS</mark></h2>
        <div class="text-content width-80">
          <p> <strong>My first goal</strong> was to simply improve on how to detect bugs. If I can find bugs faster, I can do my job better. When I first started, I struggled
            to find the source of a bug because there were so many files involved that I did not understand. I first had to get a good understanding
            of the source code and how it was organized. Eventually, I naturally became more adept at knowing the general location of the bug, but still had to reach out every
            now and then to coworkers.
            <br>
            <strong>My second goal</strong> was to write documentation for defects clearly and with enough detail. If I wanted to write a good report then I needed to provide all context 
            involved that another developer might need in order to find and reproduce the bug themselves. I later found out that most of the bugs I came across were already reported, so I ended
            up providing additional context to existing bug reports. The reports were documented on a management application called <u>Jira</u>. It contains boards for developers to post defect reports
            and other issues. I found that using this kind of task management software is a crucial skill many employers in my field expect to have, so I am glad I did this goal. 
            <br>
            <strong>My third goal</strong> was simply note taking important information and progress in my notebook. This is also a practice I did in my last work term. I found that
            having simple information about quick tutorials and commonly found defects helped me save time when I was working. The information is conveniently at the reach of my fingertips and helps
            me remember steps for certain procedures. For example, there was one time I forgot how to clone a repository on <u>BitBucket</u> (A code hosting service), but because I wrote steps on cloning 
            in my notebook, I saved myself some time and didn't need to ask a coworker.

            <h3 style="padding-left: 1vw;">Testing Software & Tools</h3>
            <p>As an automation developer, my role is to run test cases and identify any errors or bugs that may occur when testing the <strong>PolicyCenter</strong> application.
              In order to run these test cases, I use an application called <strong>Eclipse</strong>, which is an <u>Integrated Development Environment</u> (IDE), as well as a tool called
              <strong>Selenium</strong>. Selenium allows developers to run <strong>automated browsers</strong>, which are browsers run by computers instead of humans. It is kind of like 
              running a script with pre-written instructions that tells the browser what buttons to click and what input to deliver. Eclipse is somewhat similar to code editors
              like visual studio code or Atom, but Eclipse is meant for building automation tools. It also works best with Java, which is the language we used to write the code 
              that runs the test cases. The test cases themselves are actually large chunks of data containing a variety of sample information, where each test case has their own
              sets of data (e.g. credentials, address, pricing, etc) that will be used when the time comes. Excel datasheets are used to store the test cases and their data. 
              For example, when the automation browser begins it will select a specific test case to run and then will grab the name and password for that specific test case to input 
              inside the browser.

        <div class="text-content" style="width: 80%; padding-right: 2rem;">
          <h3 style="padding-left: 1vw;">Documentation </h3>
          <p>A particular aspect of my work I would like to focus on that isn't discussed often in school is documentation. When a team is responsible
            for writing a lot of code, that code will need to be maintained daily, especially if the code is expected to be used for the next couple of years. If all the old developers
            eventually leave the team or retire and new developers join the team, how will they know how to run the software if there's no one left to explain it? That's where documentation
            comes in: a way to describe and communicate the purpose and aspects of some software to future developers. It is kind of like writing a tutorial for how 
            to run the test  cases. Although documentation is considered one of the most boring parts of being a developer, I do sincerely believe it also one of the most important.
            During my experience at the co-operators, I read an abundant amount of information on how to run and create test cases with the excel spreadsheets, as well as what each class was 
            responsible for in the java code. The documents were written by one of my coworkers in my team, and I was even given the task to write some documents myself that would provide feedback
            on how my coworker's documents were. The general writing style of a document is somewhat like a tutorial. One would begin with an introduction, then they provide the layout of the contents of whatever you
            are writing about (e.g. file structure, directories, variable name cases, etc.). Next, describing each component in detail and their purpose/use case is necessary (e.g. describing what
            each class does in a Java package). Moreover, Usage is necessary, which describes how to actually run a program or file. Finally, a conclusion or brief summary is used. There are many 
            different forms of documentation. What I described is mostly for a 'README' kind of document. Others might be for providing steps on how to 
            debug a specific defect. You could say this website is like a document as well, since it is meant to reflect my work experience.

        <h2 id="conclusion" style="padding-top: 3.3rem; margin-top: 0rem;"> <mark>CONCLUSION</mark></h2>

        <div class="text-content width-80" >
          <p> I learned a large variety of helpful skills both technical and non-technical during this work term. I exposed myself to professional tools test developers use, which were
            <strong>Jira, BitBucket, Eclipse, </strong> and <strong>Selenium</strong>. I also gained proficiency in more broad concepts such as documenting bugs or code, 
            notetaking, intuitively understanding why a bug is occuring, and much more. Documentation was a concept I especially learned more about, and I hope I can learn more about it
            at school. It's quite amusing that test developers may end up writing more english than code, because of all the documentation and communication they have to do, but I don't mind that.
            After running automated browsers that test the <strong>PolicyCenter</strong> website, I am eager to learn more about front-end development in my next work term.
            Overall, I can confidently say I have succeeded in my goals I set myself, and am now much more proficient in the field of work known as <strong>test automation</strong>.

        <div class="text-content width-80" >
          <p> As I mentioned before, I worked with 4 other developers, and I would like to give a big, large thank you to each of them for guiding me throughout my work term. I'd like to begin
            by showing my gratitude to <strong>Emil Sathiya</strong>. He is a senior test automation developer and the manager of our team, as well as the man who interviewed me. I have my respect 
            to him as an experienced mentor who professionally identified all the bugs I could not. <strong>Joseph Coffa</strong> and <strong>Ozair Ashfaq</strong> are system developers who, like Emil,
            also mentored me and answered many of my questions about the automation and its many files of code. <strong>Laiba Javaid</strong> is another UofG co-op student who I worked with, and she had 
            previous work terms at the place so she was assigned to teach me the basics of the automation and its tools. Finally, <strong>Terrence McLean</strong>, who is another senior manager overseeing
            multiple QA teams, was my contact for HR purposes. He helped set me up for the work term, introduced me to the office, and gave me lots of helpful advice.
